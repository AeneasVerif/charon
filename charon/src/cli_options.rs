of the MIR code.

This is only used to make sure the reconstructed code is of good quality.
For instance, if we have the following CFG in MIR:
  ```
  b0: switch x [true -> goto b1; false -> goto b2]
  b1: y := 0; goto b3
  b2: y := 1; goto b3
  b3: return y      
  ```

We want to reconstruct the control-flow as:
  ```
  if x then { y := 0; } else { y := 1 };
  return y;
  ```

But if we don't do this reconstruction correctly, we might duplicate
the code starting at b3:
  ```
  if x then { y := 0; return y; } else { y := 1; return y; }
  ```

When activating this flag, we check that no such things happen.

Also note that it is sometimes not possible to prevent code duplication,
if the original Rust looks like this for instance:
  ```
  match x with
  | E1(y,_) | E2(_,y) => { ... } // Some branches are \"fused\"
  | E3 => { ... }
  ```

The reason is that assignments are introduced when desugaring the pattern
matching, and those assignments are specific to the variant on which we pattern
match (the `E1` branch performs: `y := (x as E1).0`, while the `E2` branch
performs: `y := (x as E2).1`). Producing a better reconstruction is non-trivial.
