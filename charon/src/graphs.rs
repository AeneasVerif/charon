/// - g1 and g2 are mutually recursive
/// - h calls g1
///
/// When translating those functions, we group together the mutually recursive
/// functions, because they have to be extracted in one single group, and thus
/// apply Tarjan's algorithm on the call graph to find out which functions are
/// mutually recursive.
/// The implementation of Tarjan's algorithm we use gives us the Strongly Connected
/// Components of the call graph in an arbitrary order, so we can have:
/// [[f], [g1, g2], [h]], but also [[h], [f], [g2, g1]], etc.
///
/// If the user defined those functions in the order: f, g1, h, g2, we want
/// to reorder them into: f, g1, g2, h, so that we can translate the mutually
/// recursive functions together, while performing a minimal amount of reordering.
/// And if reordering is not needed, because the user defined those functions
/// in the order f, g1, g2, h, or g1, g2, f, h or ... then we want to translate
/// them in this exact order.
///
/// This function performs just that: provided the order in which the definitions
/// were defined, and the SCCs of the call graph, return an order suitable for
/// translation and where the amount of reorderings is minimal with regards to
/// the initial order.
///
/// This function is also used to generate the backward functions in a stable
/// manner: the order is provided by the order in which the user listed the
/// region parameters in the function signature, and the graph is the hierarchy
/// graph (or region subtyping graph) between those regions.
