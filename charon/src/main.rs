//! Charon is a tool which compiles Rust projects (by querying their MIR) to
//! an easy-to-use format called LLBC (Low-Level Borrow Calculus), which is
//! basically MIR cleaned up and where the control-flow has been reconstructed.
//! This AST is serialized as JSON files.
//!
//!
//! We structured the project by following the approach used by [rust-clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).
//! In order to query the results of the Rustc compiler, we need to implement
//! a driver which calls Rustc while giving it some callbacks.
//! The problem is that finding the proper arguments to call Rustc with can
//! be difficult. For instance, provided the project we want to analyse with
//! Charon has already been built (and in particular its dependencies), it is
//! very difficult to provide the proper `--extern` arguments, indicating
//! where to find the compiled external dependencies. For instance, even if
//! we look in the `target` folder, the compiled depedencies are decorated
//! with a hash, and we don't know where this hash comes from.
//! Computing those arguments is, however, Cargo's responsability. As a
//! consequence, we follow Clippy's approach by piggy-backing on Cargo.  We
//! call Cargo as if we were building the project, but set up the environment
//! variable `RUSTC_WORKSPACE_WRAPPER` so that Cargo calls `charon-driver`
//! instead of Rustc upon building the target project. More specifically:
//! Cargo will call Rustc to build the dependencies, *then* will call
//! charon-driver with the arguments it would have given to Rustc to build
//! the target project.
//! Upon being called, charon-driver (see `charon_driver`) will simply call
//! Rustc with the arguments it was provided (and a few minor modifications).
//! Also, in order to transmit options from cargo-charon (this file)
//! to charon-driver (`charon-driver`), we serialize those options and store
//! them in a specific environment variable, so that charon-driver can
//! deserialize them later and use them to guide the extraction in the
//! callbacks.
