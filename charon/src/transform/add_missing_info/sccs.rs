/// Compute the SCCs (Strongly Connected Components) of a set of identifiers, where the order of
/// the SCCs and the order of the identifiers inside the SCCs attempt to respect as much as
/// possible the sort order given. The provided `sort_by` should be cheap.
///
/// This is used to generate the translated definitions in a consistent and stable manner. For
/// instance, let's say we extract 4 definitions  `f`, `g1`, `g2` and `h`, where:
/// - `g1` and `g2` are mutually recursive
/// - `h` calls `g1`
///
/// When translating those functions, we group together the mutually recursive
/// functions, because they have to be extracted in one single group, and thus
/// apply Tarjan's algorithm on the call graph to find out which functions are
/// mutually recursive.
/// The implementation of Tarjan's algorithm we use gives us the Strongly Connected
/// SCCs of the call graph in an arbitrary order, so we can have:
/// `[[f], [g1, g2], [h]]`, but also `[[h], [f], [g2, g1]]`, etc.
///
/// If the user defined those functions in the order: `f, g1, h, g2`, we want
/// to reorder them into: `f, g1, g2, h`, so that we can translate the mutually
/// recursive functions together, while performing a minimal amount of reordering.
/// And if reordering is not needed, because the user defined those functions
/// in the order `f, g1, g2, h`, or `g1, g2, f, h` or ... then we want to translate
/// them in this exact order.
///
/// The order in which Tarjan's algorithm generates the SCCs is arbitrary, while we want to keep as
/// much as possible the original order (the order in which the user generated the ids). For this,
/// we iterate through the ordered ids and try to add the SCC containing the id to a new list of
/// SCCs Of course, this SCC might have dependencies, so we need to add the dependencies first (in
/// which case we have reordering to do). This is what this function does: we add an SCC and its
/// dependencies to the list of reordered SCCs by doing a depth-first search.
