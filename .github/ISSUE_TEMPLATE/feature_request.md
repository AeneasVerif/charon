<!--
Thank you for submitting a feature request! Please check this isn't already reported in another
issue.

If the current Charon behavior is *incorrect*, please file a bug report instead. If this is about
a part of the rust language that we don't support, please open an "Unsupported language feature"
issue instead.

Please provide as much information as you can to help us understand your use-case. What's most
helpful is small reproducible examples and clear explanations of expected behavior.
-->

**Code snippet**:

<!--
Provide a short code example that illustrates your feature request.
-->

```rust

```

**Current Charon output**:

<!--
Provide the output of Charon on the code snippet. Run `charon` with `--pretty-llbc` and provide the
full output (or the relevant parts).
-->

**Extra context**: (describe the situation you're in and what problem you're trying to solve)

**Desired behavior**: (explain what output you would like to get)
