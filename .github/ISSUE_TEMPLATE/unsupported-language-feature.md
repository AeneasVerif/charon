<!--
Thank you for submitting a feature report! Please check this isn't already reported in another
issue.

If the current Charon behavior is *incorrect*, please file a bug report instead. 

Please provide as much information as you can to help us understand your use-case. What's most
helpful is small reproducible examples and clear explanations of expected behavior.
-->

**Code snippet that is not correctly supported**:

<!--
Provide the rust code you would like Charon to support. Make it as small as possible.
-->

```rust
// add your code here

```

**Current Charon output**:

<!--
Provide the output of Charon on the code snippet:
- If it causes an error, run `charon` with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and provide the full error message;
- If it causes no error, run `charon` with `--pretty-llbc` and provide the full output (or the relevant parts).
-->

```
// paste the output here

```

**Expected behavior**: (explain how you think Charon should extract this code)
