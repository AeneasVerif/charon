(** Signature for a module describing an identifier.
    
    We often need identifiers (for definitions, variables, etc.) and in
    order to make sure we don't mix them, we use a generative functor
    (see {!IdGen}).

    Because {!Id.id} is an opaque type, even though it is [int] in practice
    it is not possible to mix ids coming from two different instances of the
    {!IdGen} functor.

    For instance, if we do:
    {[
      module TypeDeclId = IdGen ()
      module VariantId = IdGen ()
      module FieldId = IdGen ()
    ]}

    the types [TypeDeclId.id], [VariantId.id] and [FieldId.id] will be
    considered as different by the OCaml typechecker.

    This is especially useful when one manipulates functions which take
    several ids of different kinds as inputs: if identifiers were (transparently)
    integers, we could mix them, while here the compiler prevents us from doing us,
    avoiding mistakes which are easy to do and hard to debug.

    It is sometimes necessary to generate ids from integers (and convert ids to
    integers), and we provide functions for doing so: they should of course be
    manipulated with care. In this regard, the point of {!Id} is not so much to have
    opaque types but rather to provide a way of manipulating ids in a disciplined
    manner, to prevent bugs by leveraging the typechecker.

  (** This function should be used in the rare cases where we have a list whose
      elements should be indexable through ids (for example, the fields of
      a structure can be indexed by the field id).

      Note that in Rust we have a special vector type for such lists, and it
      works well because Rust has typeclasses. We hesitated to have a special
      type in OCaml too but it proved too cumbersome to use so we finally
      resorted to having lists.
