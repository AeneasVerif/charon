      (** The targets for a switch over an integer are:
          - the list [(matched values, statement to execute)]
            We need a list for the matched values in case we do something like this:
            [switch n { 0 | 1 => ..., _ => ... }]
          - the "otherwise" statement
          Also note that we precise the type of the integer (uint32, int64, etc.)
          which we switch on. *)
  | Match of place * (variant_id list * statement) list * statement option
      (** A match over an ADT.

          Similar comments as for {!SwitchInt}. Note that the "otherwise" branch
          is optional.
