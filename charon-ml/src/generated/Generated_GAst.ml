(** (U)LLBC is a language with side-effects: a statement may abort in a way that

    is introduced to avoid a lot of small branches.

    We translate MIR asserts (introduced for out-of-bounds accesses or divisions
    by zero for instance) to this. We then eliminate them in
    [crate::transform::resugar::reconstruct_fallible_operations], because
    they're implicit in the semantics of our array accesses etc. Finally we
    introduce new asserts in [crate::transform::resugar::reconstruct_asserts].

          The [drop_in_place] method is added by Charon to the [Destruct] trait
          to make it possible to track drop code in polymorphic code. It
          contains the same code as the [core::ptr::drop_in_place<T>] builtin

          moved out of), may be conditional on the code path that led to it, or
          become an async drop. The exact semantics are left intentionally
          unspecified by rustc developers. To elaborate such drops into precise
          drops, pass [--precise-drops] to Charon.

          A conditional drop may also be passed an unaligned place when dropping
          fields of packed structs. Such a thing is UB for a precise drop.

    In case of a trait declaration, we don't include the provided methods (the
    methods with a default implementation): they will be translated on a
    per-need basis. This is important for two reasons:
    - this makes the trait definitions a lot smaller (the Iterator trait has
      *one* declared function and more than 70 provided functions)
    - this is important for the external traits, whose provided methods often
      use features we don't support yet

    Remark: In Aeneas, we still translate the provided methods on an individual
    basis, and in such a way thay they take as input a trait instance. This
    means that we can use default methods *but*:
    - implementations of required methods shoudln't call default methods
    - trait implementations shouldn't redefine required methods The use case we
      have in mind is [std::iter::Iterator]: it declares one required method
      ([next]) that should be implemented for every iterator, and defines many
      helpers like [all], [map], etc. that shouldn't be re-implemented. Of
