  | Assign of place * rvalue

  | CopyNonOverlapping of copy_non_overlapping
      (** Equivalent to std::intrinsics::copy_nonoverlapping; this is not modelled as a function
        call as it cannot diverge
     *)
  | StorageLive of local_id

        * ...
        *)

and switch =
  | If of operand * block * block
      (** Gives the [if] block and the [else] block. The [Operand] is the condition of the [if], e.g. [if (y == 0)] could become
          {@rust[
          v@3 := copy y; // Represented as [Assign(v@3, Use(Copy(y))]
          v@2 := move v@3 == 0; // Represented as [Assign(v@2, BinOp(BinOp::Eq, Move(y), Const(0)))]
          if (move v@2) { // Represented as [If(Move(v@2), <then branch>, <else branch>)]
          ]}
       *)
  | SwitchInt of
      operand * integer_type * (scalar_value list * block) list * block
      (** Gives the integer type, a map linking values to switch branches, and the
          otherwise block. Note that matches over enumerations are performed by
          switching over the discriminant, which is an integer.
          Also, we use a [Vec] to make sure the order of the switch
          branches is preserved.

          Rk.: we use a vector of values, because some of the branches may
          be grouped together, like for the following code:
          {@rust[
          match e {
            E::V1 | E::V2 => ..., // Grouped
            E::V3 => ...
          }
          ]}
       *)
  | Match of place * (variant_id list * block) list * block option
      (** A match over an ADT.

          The match statement is introduced in [crate::transform::remove_read_discriminant]
          (whenever we find a discriminant read, we merge it with the subsequent
          switch into a match).
