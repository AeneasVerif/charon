type block = { span : span; statements : statement list }

(** A raw statement: a statement without meta data. *)
and raw_statement =
  | Assign of place * rvalue
      (** Assigns an [Rvalue] to a [Place]. e.g. [let y = x;] could become
          [y := move x] which is represented as
          [Assign(y, Rvalue::Use(Operand::Move(x)))]. *)
  | SetDiscriminant of place * variant_id
      (** Not used today because we take MIR built. *)
  | CopyNonOverlapping of copy_non_overlapping
      (** Equivalent to std::intrinsics::copy_nonoverlapping; this is not
          modelled as a function call as it cannot diverge *)
  | StorageLive of local_id
      (** Indicates that this local should be allocated; if it is already
          allocated, this frees the local and re-allocates it. The return value
          and arguments do not receive a [StorageLive]. We ensure in the
          micro-pass [insert_storage_lives] that all other locals have a
          [StorageLive] associated with them. *)
  | StorageDead of local_id
      (** Indicates that this local should be deallocated; if it is already
          deallocated, this is a no-op. A local may not have a [StorageDead] in
          the function's body, in which case it is implicitly deallocated at the
          end of the function. *)
  | Deinit of place
  | Drop of place
      (** Drop the value at the given place.

          For MIR built and promoted, this is a conditional drop: the value will
          only be dropped if it has not already been moved out. For MIR
          elaborated and optimized, this is a real drop.

          This drop is then equivalent to a call to
          [std::ptr::drop_in_place(&raw mut place)]. *)
  | Assert of assertion
  | Call of call
  | Abort of abort_kind
      (** Panic also handles "unreachable". We keep the name of the panicking
          function that was called. *)
  | Return
  | Break of int
      (** Break to outer loops. The [usize] gives the index of the outer loop to
          break to: * 0: break to first outer loop (the current loop) * 1: break
          to second outer loop * ... *)
  | Continue of int
      (** Continue to outer loops. The [usize] gives the index of the outer loop
          to continue to: * 0: continue to first outer loop (the current loop) *
          1: continue to second outer loop * ... *)
  | Nop  (** No-op. *)
  | Switch of switch
  | Loop of block
  | Error of string

and statement = {
  span : span;
  content : raw_statement;
  comments_before : string list;  (** Comments that precede this statement. *)
}

and switch =
  | If of operand * block * block
      (** Gives the [if] block and the [else] block. The [Operand] is the
          condition of the [if], e.g. [if (y == 0)] could become
          {@rust[
            v@3 := copy y; // Represented as [Assign(v@3, Use(Copy(y))]
            v@2 := move v@3 == 0; // Represented as [Assign(v@2, BinOp(BinOp::Eq, Move(y), Const(0)))]
            if (move v@2) { // Represented as [If(Move(v@2), <then branch>, <else branch>)]
          ]} *)
  | SwitchInt of
      operand * integer_type * (scalar_value list * block) list * block
      (** Gives the integer type, a map linking values to switch branches, and
          the otherwise block. Note that matches over enumerations are performed
          by switching over the discriminant, which is an integer. Also, we use
          a [Vec] to make sure the order of the switch branches is preserved.

          Rk.: we use a vector of values, because some of the branches may be
          grouped together, like for the following code:
          {@rust[
            match e {
              E::V1 | E::V2 => ..., // Grouped
              E::V3 => ...
            }
          ]} *)
  | Match of place * (variant_id list * block) list * block option
      (** A match over an ADT.

          The match statement is introduced in
          [crate::transform::remove_read_discriminant] (whenever we find a
          discriminant read, we merge it with the subsequent switch into a
          match). *)
