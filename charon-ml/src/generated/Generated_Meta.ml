        Note that this is different from being part of the crate's public API: to be part of the
        public API, an item has to also be reachable from public items in the crate root. For
        example:
        {@rust[
        mod foo {
            pub struct X;
        }
        mod bar {

        }
        pub use bar::something; // exposes [X]
        ]}
        Without the [pub use ...], neither [X] nor [something] would be part of the crate's public
        API (this is called "pub-in-priv" items). With or without the [pub use], we set [public =
        true]; computing item reachability is harder.
