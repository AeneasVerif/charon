(** Type-level variable.

    Variables are bound in groups. Each item has a top-level binding group in its [generic_params]
    field, and then inner binders are possible using the [RegionBinder<T>] and [Binder<T>] types.
    Each variable is linked to exactly one binder. The [Id] then identifies the specific variable
    among all those bound in that group.

    For instance, we have the following:
    {@rust[
    fn f<'a, 'b>(x: for<'c> fn(&'b u8, &'c u16, for<'d> fn(&'b u32, &'c u64, &'d u128)) -> u64) {}
         ^^^^^^         ^^       ^       ^          ^^       ^        ^        ^
           |       inner binder  |       |     inner binder  |        |        |
     top-level binder            |       |                   |        |        |
                           Bound(1, b)   |              Bound(2, b)   |     Bound(0, d)
                                         |                            |

    ]}

    To make consumption easier for projects that don't do heavy substitution, a micro-pass at the
    end changes the variables bound at the top-level (i.e. in the [GenericParams] of items) to be
    [Free]. This is an optional pass, we may add a flag to deactivate it. The example above
    becomes:
    {@rust[
    fn f<'a, 'b>(x: for<'c> fn(&'b u8, &'c u16, for<'d> fn(&'b u32, &'c u64, &'d u128)) -> u64) {}

           |       inner binder  |       |     inner binder  |        |        |
     top-level binder            |       |                   |        |        |
                              Free(b)    |                Free(b)     |     Bound(0, d)
                                         |                            |
                                     Bound(0, c)                 Bound(1, c)

    A type in Rust can have several "impl" blocks, and  those blocks can
    contain items with similar names. For this reason, we need to disambiguate
    them with unique indices. Rustc calls those "disambiguators". In rustc, this
    gives names like this:
    - [betree_main::betree::NodeIdCounter{impl#0}::new]
    - note that impl blocks can be nested, and macros sometimes generate
      weird names (which require disambiguation):
      [betree_main::betree_utils::_#1::{impl#0}::deserialize::{impl#0}]

    Finally, the paths used by rustc are a lot more precise and explicit than
    those we expose in LLBC: for instance, every identifier belongs to a specific
    namespace (value namespace, type namespace, etc.), and is coupled with a
    disambiguator.

    On our side, we want to stay high-level and simple: we use string identifiers
    as much as possible, insert disambiguators only when necessary (whenever
    we find an "impl" block, typically) and check that the disambiguator is useless
    in the other situations (i.e., the disambiguator is always equal to 0).

    Moreover, the items are uniquely disambiguated by their (integer) ids
    ([TypeDeclId], etc.), and when extracting the code we have to deal with
    name clashes anyway. Still, we might want to be more precise in the future.

    Also note that the first path element in the name is always the crate name.
