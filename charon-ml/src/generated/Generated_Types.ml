(** The index of a binder, counting from the innermost. See [[DeBruijnVar]] for
    details. *)
type de_bruijn_id = int

(** Type-level variable.

    Variables are bound in groups. Each item has a top-level binding group in
    its [generic_params] field, and then inner binders are possible using the
    [RegionBinder<T>] and [Binder<T>] types. Each variable is linked to exactly
    one binder. The [Id] then identifies the specific variable among all those
    bound in that group.

    For instance, we have the following:
    {@rust[
      fn f<'a, 'b>(x: for<'c> fn(&'b u8, &'c u16, for<'d> fn(&'b u32, &'c u64, &'d u128)) -> u64) {}
           ^^^^^^         ^^       ^       ^          ^^       ^        ^        ^
             |       inner binder  |       |     inner binder  |        |        |
       top-level binder            |       |                   |        |        |
                             Bound(1, b)   |              Bound(2, b)   |     Bound(0, d)
                                           |                            |
                                       Bound(0, c)                 Bound(1, c)
    ]}

    To make consumption easier for projects that don't do heavy substitution,
    [--unbind-item-vars] changes the variables bound at the top-level (i.e. in
    the [GenericParams] of items) to be [Free]. The example above becomes:

    ADT and tuple instances as constants when generating MIR:
    - an enumeration with one variant and no fields is a constant.
    - a structure with no field is a constant.
    - sometimes, Rust stores the initialization of an ADT as a constant (if all
      the fields are constant) rather than as an aggregated value We later
      desugar those to regular ADTs, see [regularize_constant_adts.rs].

    [[ConstantExprKind::Global]] case: access to a global variable. We later
    desugar it to a copy of a place global.

    [[ConstantExprKind::Ref]] case: reference to a constant value. We later
    desugar it to a separate statement.

    [[ConstantExprKind::FnPtr]] case: a function pointer (to a top-level
    function).

(** An item name/path

    A name really is a list of strings. However, we sometimes need to introduce
    unique indices to disambiguate. This mostly happens because of "impl"
    blocks:
    {@rust[
      impl<T> List<T> {
        ...
      }
    ]}

    A type in Rust can have several "impl" blocks, and those blocks can contain
    items with similar names. For this reason, we need to disambiguate them with
    unique indices. Rustc calls those "disambiguators". In rustc, this gives
    names like this:
    - [betree_main::betree::NodeIdCounter{impl#0}::new]
    - note that impl blocks can be nested, and macros sometimes generate weird
      names (which require disambiguation):
      [betree_main::betree_utils::_#1::{impl#0}::deserialize::{impl#0}]

    Finally, the paths used by rustc are a lot more precise and explicit than
    those we expose in LLBC: for instance, every identifier belongs to a
    specific namespace (value namespace, type namespace, etc.), and is coupled
    with a disambiguator.

    On our side, we want to stay high-level and simple: we use string
    identifiers as much as possible, insert disambiguators only when necessary
    (whenever we find an "impl" block, typically) and check that the
    disambiguator is useless in the other situations (i.e., the disambiguator is
    always equal to 0).

    Moreover, the items are uniquely disambiguated by their (integer) ids
    ([TypeDeclId], etc.), and when extracting the code we have to deal with name
    clashes anyway. Still, we might want to be more precise in the future.

    Also note that the first path element in the name is always the crate name.
