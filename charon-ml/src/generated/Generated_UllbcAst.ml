          pointer in memory). *)
  | CopyNonOverlapping of copy_non_overlapping
      (** Equivalent to std::intrinsics::copy_nonoverlapping; this is not
          modelled as a function call as it cannot diverge *)
  | StorageLive of local_id
      (** Indicates that this local should be allocated; if it is already
          allocated, this frees the local and re-allocates it. The return value
          and arguments do not receive a [StorageLive]. We ensure in the
          micro-pass [insert_storage_lives] that all other locals have a
          [StorageLive] associated with them. *)
  | StorageDead of local_id
      (** Indicates that this local should be deallocated; if it is already
          deallocated, this is a no-op. A local may not have a [StorageDead] in
          the function's body, in which case it is implicitly deallocated at the
          end of the function. *)

  | Assert of assertion * abort_kind
      (** A non-diverging runtime check for a condition. This can be either:
          - Emitted for inlined "assumes" (which cause UB on failure)
          - Reconstructed from [if b { panic() }] if [--reconstruct-asserts] is
            set. This statement comes with the effect that happens when the
            check fails (rather than representing it as an unwinding edge).

  | If of block_id * block_id  (** Gives the [if] block and the [else] block *)
  | SwitchInt of literal_type * (literal * block_id) list * block_id
      (** Gives the integer type, a map linking values to switch branches, and
          the otherwise block. Note that matches over enumerations are performed
          by switching over the discriminant, which is an integer. *)
