          call as it cannot diverge

  | StorageLive of local_id
      (** Indicates that this local should be allocated; if it is already allocated, this frees
          the local and re-allocates it. The return value and arguments do not receive a
          [StorageLive]. We ensure in the micro-pass [insert_storage_lives] that all other locals
          have a [StorageLive] associated with them.

          a no-op. A local may not have a [StorageDead] in the function's body, in which case it
          is implicitly deallocated at the end of the function.

  | Drop of place
  | Assert of assertion
      (** A built-in assert, which corresponds to runtime checks that we remove, namely: bounds
          checks, over/underflow checks, div/rem by zero checks, pointer alignement check.

  | SwitchInt of integer_type * (scalar_value * block_id) list * block_id

          otherwise block. Note that matches over enumerations are performed by
          switching over the discriminant, which is an integer.
