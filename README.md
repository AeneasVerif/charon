# Charon
Charon acts as an interface between the rustc compiler and program verification projects. Its
purpose is to extract useful information from .rs file and process it into a format easy
to handle by other projects, with program verification in mind.

Charon is, in Greek mythology, an old man taking the souls of the deceased to
carry them on his boat accross the Styx, a river separating the world of the living from
the world of the dead. In the present context, Charon allows us to go from the world of
Rust programs to the world of formal verification.
