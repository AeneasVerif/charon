# Charon
Charon acts as an interface between the rustc compiler and program verification projects. Its
purpose is to process Rust .rs files into files easy to handle by program verifiers.

Charon is, in Greek mythology, an old man carrying the souls of the deceased accross the
Styx, a river separating the world of the living from the world of the dead. In the
present context, Charon allows us to go from the world of Rust programs to the world of
formal verification.
